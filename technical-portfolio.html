  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">That is where I came in!!!</p>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">I built a front-end for their notification API URL Path with fields that they

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">In 2020 I spent 3 months working for my parents on their Course App Web.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">They have a ministry named Heart-Shaped Parenting where they teach people about Christian Parenting</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">They wrote a book and from that book they had created several video courses that people could watch.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">However, they did not like any of the course platforms that were currently in existence.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">So, they hired me to design and build an online course app for them.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">This platform had to allow users to purchase courses that would be added to their account.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">Then they could stream these courses from our web app and the app would keep track of their progress through the course.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">I built both the front and back end for this application. Using Flutter to create the front-end and firebase to host the account details, web app and videos on the back-end. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">After 3 months it was fully functional and to this day it has been used for individuals and churches to stream their content.</p>
