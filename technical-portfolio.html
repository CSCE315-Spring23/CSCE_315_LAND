    <p class="text-paragraph">In Summer 2020 I had a 2 week 
      internship with Novitech Digital,
      an app design company in
       Pretoria, South Africa.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">They had created a app for one of
      the major Health Insurance Providers
      in South Africa.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">The app connected Doctors to their 
      patients securely and quickly,
      which was phenomenal in the 
      midst of rampant Covid.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">It worked really well and doctors were
      able to remotely video call and 
      prescribe medicine to their patients.  </p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">However, they had a problem... 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">Their corporate managers wanted to be able to send notifications. 
      
      Corporate managers...</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">
      And the way to send notifications was through an API URL path... 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">That is where I came in!!!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">I built a front-end for their notification API URL Path with fields that they
      could edit, animations and previews
      for each type of notication.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">It was responsive and easy to use.

      And it's still in use!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p class="text-paragraph">In the years since I first created it, it
      has been used to send messages to
      tens of thousands of their users!</p>
